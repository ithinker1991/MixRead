    <h1>English Test Article</h1>
    <p>This is a <strong>comprehensive</strong> test of the MixRead extension. The system should highlight difficult words based on your proficiency level. Words like <em>extraordinary</em>, <strong>magnificent</strong>, and <u>phenomenal</u> might be highlighted for intermediate learners.</p>

    <p>The algorithm analyzes word frequency and difficulty to determine which words should be annotated. This helps readers focus on vocabulary that matches their learning objectives. More <strong>advanced</strong> readers might see fewer highlights, while <em>beginners</em> will get more assistance.</p>

    <p>Understanding context is crucial for language acquisition. When you encounter an <strong>unfamiliar</strong> word, take a moment to read the entire sentence. The surrounding words often provide valuable clues about meaning.</p>

    <h2>Testing Library Features</h2>
    <p>You can add words to your personal library for later review. This feature helps you keep track of vocabulary you want to learn. Click the "Add to Library" button when you see highlighted words that interest you.</p>

    <p>The batch marking feature allows you to quickly mark multiple words as known or unknown. This is especially useful when reviewing articles with many highlighted terms.</p>
