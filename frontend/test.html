            transformed how we communicate. Serendipity often plays a role in discovering new learning methods.

        <p>
            Effective reading comprehension involves understanding context, recognizing word patterns,
            and building vocabulary systematically. The pedagogical approach emphasizes both explicit
            instruction and incidental learning through exposure.
