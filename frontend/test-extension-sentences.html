    <h1>Test Sentence Extraction</h1>

    <p>This is a test page for the <strong>MixRead</strong> extension. The purpose of this page is to verify that sentence extraction works correctly when words are marked and added to the library.</p>

    <p>Here is a comprehensive sentence that contains the word "comprehensive" multiple times. This comprehensive test should help us understand if sentence extraction is working properly.</p>

    <p>Learning requires dedication and consistent practice. Students should review their lessons daily. Understanding comes gradually through repetition and application.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First: The difficult problem required extensive research.</li>
        <li>Second: Understanding complex concepts takes time.</li>
        <li>Third: Testing knowledge regularly improves retention.</li>
    </ul>
